# Feature Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of all features in the Broker-Carrier Packet SaaS MVP.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

**What it does**: Ensures complete data isolation between different brokers.

**How it works**:
- Each broker has a unique ID linked to their Supabase auth account
- Database Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce access control at the database level
- Brokers can only see and manage their own packets
- No broker can access another broker's data

**Technical implementation**:
- RLS policies on `packets` table filter by `broker_id = auth.uid()`
- Middleware checks authentication before allowing API access
- All file uploads are stored in broker-specific folders

### 2. Broker Account Management

#### 2.1 Signup

**What it does**: Allows new brokers to create an account.

**How it works**:
1. Broker fills out signup form with company name, email, and password
2. System creates a Supabase auth account
3. System creates a broker profile in the `brokers` table
4. Broker receives a session token and is logged in

**Validation**:
- Email must be valid format
- Password must be at least 6 characters
- Company name is required
- Email must be unique

**Files involved**:
- Frontend: `frontend/index.html`
- Backend: `backend/routes/auth.js` (signup route)

#### 2.2 Login

**What it does**: Allows existing brokers to access their account.

**How it works**:
1. Broker enters email and password
2. System validates credentials with Supabase Auth
3. System retrieves broker profile from database
4. Broker receives session token and access to dashboard

**Security**:
- Passwords are hashed by Supabase Auth
- JWT tokens expire after session timeout
- Session stored in browser localStorage

**Files involved**:
- Frontend: `frontend/index.html`
- Backend: `backend/routes/auth.js` (login route)

#### 2.3 Logout

**What it does**: Securely ends broker session.

**How it works**:
1. Broker clicks logout button
2. System invalidates session token
3. Browser localStorage is cleared
4. Broker is redirected to login page

**Files involved**:
- Frontend: `frontend/dashboard.html`
- Backend: `backend/routes/auth.js` (logout route)

### 3. Packet Management

#### 3.1 Upload Packet

**What it does**: Allows brokers to upload PDF carrier packets.

**How it works**:
1. Broker fills in carrier name and email
2. Broker selects a PDF file from their computer
3. System validates the file (PDF only, max 10MB)
4. File is uploaded to broker-specific folder
5. Packet record is created in database with 'pending' status

**Validation**:
- Only PDF files accepted
- File size limit: 10MB
- Carrier name and email are required
- Email must be valid format

**Storage**:
- Files stored in `uploads/{broker_id}/{filename}`
- Filename includes timestamp and UUID to prevent conflicts

**Files involved**:

- Backend: `backend/routes/packets.js` (upload route)

#### 3.2 Send Packet to Carrier

**What it does**: Sends an email to the carrier with a secure signing link.

**How it works**:
1. Broker clicks "Send to Carrier" button

#### 3.3 View All Packets

**What it does**: Displays all packets for the logged-in broker.

**How it works**:
1. Dashboard fetches all packets for current broker
2. Packets are displayed in a table with status badges
3. Table shows carrier info, dates, and actions
4. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

**Status indicators**:
- **Pending**: Yellow badge - not yet sent to carrier
- **Sent**: Blue badge - email sent, waiting for signature
- **Signed**: Green badge - carrier has signed

**Files involved**:
- Frontend: `frontend/dashboard.html`
- Backend: `backend/routes/packets.js` (get all packets route)

### 4. Carrier Signing Workflow

#### 4.1 Access Signing Page

**What it does**: Allows carriers to access packets without creating an account.

**How it works**:
1. Carrier receives email with secure link
2. Link contains unique token
3. Carrier clicks link and is taken to signing page
4. System validates token and loads packet

**Security**:
- No authentication required (passwordless)
- Access controlled by secure token
- Token is single-use (packet can only be signed once)

**Files involved**:
- Frontend: `frontend/sign.html`
- Backend: `backend/routes/signatures.js` (get packet by token)

#### 4.2 Review Document

**What it does**: Displays the PDF for carrier review.

**How it works**:
1. PDF is loaded in an iframe viewer
2. Carrier can scroll through the document
3. Carrier can review all pages before signing

**Files involved**:
- Frontend: `frontend/sign.html`

#### 4.3 Draw Signature

**What it does**: Allows carrier to draw their signature using mouse/touch.

**How it works**:

**How it works**:
1. Carrier enters their full name
2. Carrier selects a signed PDF from their computer
3. System validates file (PDF only, max 10MB)
4. File is uploaded and stored
5. Signature record is created

**Use case**: When carrier prefers to print, sign physically, scan, and upload.

**Files involved**:
- Frontend: `frontend/sign.html`
- Backend: `backend/routes/signatures.js` (submit signature with file upload)

#### 4.5 Submit Signature

**What it does**: Finalizes the signing process.

**How it works**:
1. System validates signature data
2. Signature record is created in database
3. Packet status is updated to 'signed'
4. `signed_at` timestamp is recorded
5. Email notification is sent to broker
6. Success message is displayed to carrier
