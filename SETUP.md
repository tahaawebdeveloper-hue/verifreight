## Step 1: Install Node.js

If you don't have Node.js installed:

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions
4. Verify installation by opening Terminal/Command Prompt and typing:

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env` file in your project folder
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```env
# Supabase Configuration (from Step 2)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...your-anon-key-here

   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

4. Wait for installation to complete (may take 1-2 minutes)

## Step 6: Start the Server

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Email not sending

**Solution 1**: Make sure you're using the App Password (16 characters) from Step 3, not your regular Gmail password

**Solution 2**: Check that 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google account

**Solution 3**: Try sending a test email first to make sure your email configuration is correct

### Problem: "Database connection error"

**Solution**: Double-check your Supabase URL and anon key in the `.env` file. Make sure there are no extra spaces.

### Problem: "Cannot find module"

**Solution**: Run `npm install` again to make sure all dependencies are installed

### Problem: Port 3000 already in use

**Solution**: Change the PORT in your `.env` file to a different number (e.g., 3001, 8080)

### Problem: Cannot access http://localhost:3000

**Solution**: Make sure the server is running (you should see the startup message in Terminal/Command Prompt)

## Next Steps

Now that you have the app running, you can:

1. **Test the full workflow** multiple times with different carriers
2. **Customize the email templates** in `backend/utils/email.js`
3. **Modify the styling** in the HTML files
4. **Add new features** based on your needs
5. **Deploy to production** (see README.md for deployment instructions)

## Getting Help

If you run into issues:

1. Check the Terminal/Command Prompt for error messages
2. Check the browser console (F12 → Console tab) for errors
3. Review the README.md file for more detailed information
4. Make sure all environment variables are set correctly
5. Try restarting the server

## Stopping the Server

When you're done:

1. Go to the Terminal/Command Prompt where the server is running
2. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server
3. You can start it again anytime with `npm start`
