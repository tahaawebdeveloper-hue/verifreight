  # Broker-Carrier Packet SaaS Schema

  ## Overview
  This migration creates the database schema for a multi-tenant SaaS application 
  where brokers can create carrier packets, send them to carriers for signing, 
  and track their status.

  ## New Tables

  ### `brokers`
  Stores broker profile information linked to Supabase auth users.
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - References auth.users(id)
  - `company_name` (text) - Broker's company name
  - `email` (text, unique) - Broker's email
  - `subscription_status` (text) - Subscription tier (free, paid, etc.)
  - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Account creation timestamp

  ### `packets`
  Stores carrier packet information for each broker.
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique packet identifier
  - `broker_id` (uuid) - References brokers(id)
  - `carrier_email` (text) - Email of the carrier
  - `carrier_name` (text) - Name of the carrier
  - `packet_url` (text) - URL to the PDF in Supabase Storage
  - `status` (text) - Packet status: 'pending', 'sent', 'signed'
  - `secure_token` (text, unique) - Secure token for carrier signing link
  - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Packet creation timestamp
  - `sent_at` (timestamptz, nullable) - When email was sent
  - `signed_at` (timestamptz, nullable) - When packet was signed

  ### `signatures`
  Stores signature information for signed packets.
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique signature identifier
  - `packet_id` (uuid) - References packets(id)
  - `carrier_name` (text) - Name entered by carrier
  - `signature_data` (text) - Base64 signature image or URL to uploaded signed PDF
  - `signature_type` (text) - Type: 'draw' or 'upload'
  - `signed_at` (timestamptz) - Signature timestamp

  ## Security
  
  ### Row Level Security (RLS)
  All tables have RLS enabled with policies to ensure:
  1. Brokers can only access their own packets and signatures
  2. Carriers can access packets via secure token (no authentication required)
  3. Multi-tenant data isolation is enforced at the database level

  ### RLS Policies
  - **brokers**: Authenticated users can read/update their own profile
  - **packets**: Brokers can only view/manage their own packets
  - **signatures**: Brokers can view signatures for their packets, anyone with token can insert
